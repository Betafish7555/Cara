# Yuvinya

The great forest of Yuvinya stradles the eastern border of Alasia and Fel'Durr. It is an ancient and powerful pace that is shrouded in mystery to the common denizen of Chardon. Within the forest, lies a titanic tree that grows at the central convergance point of the tangeld leylines that crisscross over the face of Chardon. This tree has many names. The Great Knot, The World Tree, The Covergence, The Mother Tree, but most simply refer to it as the Tree of Yuvinya. 

This tree is the physical manifestation of the magic within the continent and holds great power because of it. Over the centuries, many different groups and individuals have tried to take control of this tree and it's power, but they have been fought off time and time again by the elvish gaurdians of the forest. The elves that make Yuvinya their home are highly different from the elves of Alasia or Fel'Durr. The elves within Yuvinya live their lives in service to the Mother Tree and her surrounding lands. They protect the borders of the forest and do not let outsiders enter without first proving themselves worthy. Within this elvish society is a complex strucutre of many clans who all serve different purposes in the fabric of the forest's ecosystem. These elves respect and honor the Tree and all of her creatures, and are pacisfists by nature. They do not harm or hunt any creatures within the forest and will defend the beasts from any outsider who deicdes to try to disturb them.

Because of the thick convergence of leylines within the forest, the creatures that make their home there can be extrememly powerful and dangerous. Different creautres respond to the excessively powerful leylines in different ways, some growing to tremendous sizes or developing unsual abilites. The forest's thick leylines also cause planar rifts or portals between worlds. There are many creatures within the forest that stumbled through shifting leylines from places beyond and now call Yuvinya their home. These rifts grow larger and more common the closer they are to the World Tree. It is said you can find portals to any world if you look within the tree's roots.
