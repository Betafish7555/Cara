# Hadash

Hadash is a great desert located to the north of Chardon that creates a boundary between the continent and the continent of Fera. It is is a sparsely populated country that has no formal government. The majority of the population is made out of nomadic bands that journey the wastes for survival and occasional trade with the great oasis merchant city of Venelio. Just beyond the borders of Hadash lies the Primordial Empire, a titanic imperial power in the world of Cara that controls the entire northern continent of Fera. The Primordial Empire could easily conquer the lands of Hadash with little to no effort, however the merchants of Venelio have some unknown deal with the empire that keeps them at bay. The people of the desert are split into four main groups. The Hashai, The Dashi, The Yuan-Ti tribes, and the Venelites.

The Hashai are known for their naturalist magic and powerful connection with the desert. They have an expertise in taming the great beasts of the sands and using them to their advantage. Hashai raiding parties often travel on the back of velociraptor packs and their largest settlements are villages built onto the back of tamed terrasaurs.

The Dashi people are known for their incredible ability for artifice. They travel the sands of Hadash searching for ancient ruins to excavate and ransack for parts to construct their arcane devices. Dashi people often travel on arcane sand sails and their larger settlements are technologic havens hidden away in the desert mesas.

The Yuan-ti are serpentine humanoids that are the native people of the northern deserts. Most of their settlements are located farther north nearer to the border of the Primordial Empire. The Yuan-ti are naturalists who, similar to Orcs, believe in the animalistic spirits of Cara. However, separate from the Orcs, the Yuan-ti believe this animal spirits can be communed with through the earth rather than through the stars.

Venelites is a term used for any individual who lives in the great oasis city of Venelio. The great city is built around a magically maintained oasis that gives life to all the people within its walls. The climate within the city is also magically altered to have more moisture which means that inside the walls, the climate is much closer to a tropical forest rather than a desert oasis. The city is built on excessive amounts of wealth and is controlled by the merchant class. Whoever has the most money has the most power in Venelio. Many wealthy outsiders journey to Venelio to partake in their excessive splendors and amenities. It is said that a day in Venelio without a revel is like a day in the desert without water.
