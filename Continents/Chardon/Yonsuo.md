# Yonsuo

To the southwest of Alasia, just off the coast of a great peninsula is the kingdom of Yonsuo. Yonsuo is a grouping of islands that is technically a part of the country Alasia, but is widely considered to be its own independent political and cultural body. The kingdom was included into the Binding of Summer in an effort to unite all the lands of Alasia under a single government. The islands of Yonsuo however, operate widely under their own laws and traditions, determined by the ruling Emperor. Yonsuo is a land deeply connected to its leylines and the people of the kingdom practice a form of arcane worship alongside with the traditional worship to the deity of the area. Yonsuoâ€™s leylines are extremely powerful, so much so that the veil between other realities can sometimes entirely slip away during certain times of year. Twice a year, Yonsuo holds a festival where it is said the boundary between our world and worlds beyond entirely fade away, making tremendous feats of magic possible and opening the door to spirits and beings beyond the material plane.
