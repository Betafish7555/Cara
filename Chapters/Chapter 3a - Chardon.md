# Chardon

Chardon is a continent on the western hemisphere of Cara, covering a stretch of land that bridges the continent of Kalastar to the northern deserts of Fera. The continent is characterized by its hospitable climate, wide variety of cultures and peoples, and the powerful arcane potential of the leylines running through the continent. Most of the continent’s area is taken up by the nation of Alasia, a nation created from the union of fourteen warring factions that came to peace nearly 1,000 years ago after the creation of landmark to the north of the continent known as The Pit of Algoraeix of more commonly referred to as simply The Pit, a great chasm to the north of Chardon stretching nearly 200 miles across. The continent is sometimes referred to as “The Arcane Cradle” as it was on this continent where the first wizard Mito is said to have been born and developed the process of harnessing the leylines of Cara to perform arcane magic. The land is thick with leylines that empower arcane spells and artifacts which has been a great source of conflict on the continent as many different groups and powers have tried to take control of them. The abundance of powerful leylines has also caused the continent to be frought with planar rifts that can occur where there are powerful concentrations of magical energy. These rifts often lead to many extraplanar entities finding a home on the continent, leading to a population of many strange and varied individuals as well as a wilderness filled with strange beasts, mysterious forces, and powerful monsters.
