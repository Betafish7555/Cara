# Geography 

Cara has six continents that form a circular shape across the face of the planet. To the west are the continents of Chardon and Votar. Votar is a large island that is isolated from the other continents by a great stretch of sea. Chardon serves as the connector between the central continent of Kalastar and the northern desert continent of Fera. Fera is circled around the northern hemisphere of the planet. To the East are the continents of Xorn and Duna. Xorn stretches from the southern tip of Fera all the way to the beginnings of the equator. To the southeast of the southern hemisphere is the continent of Duna, which is mostly desert due to its proximity to the Southern pole.

Because of the nature of the planetary rotation of Cara, the planet has no seasons. The farther towards the poles you travel, the hotter it gets, and the closer towards the equator, the colder it gets. Because of this, almost 80% of the world's population is located in the area of the planet that has the most favorable climate for life. This is referred to as the Sumar in elder speak or The Summer Belt or the Ring of Life. Countries that lie on this ring are as follows: Alasia, Rokarsh, Ober, Iora, Horion, Actu, Cantor, Calren, Manon, and Domnia. Countries that are partially included with the belt are Fel’Durr, Votar, Ospa, Ufreau, Huama, Vila, Lorhana, Bhamag, and The City of Steel. 

***Note***: The names of all countries in Duna and Xorn are place holders. I will make new names when I have decided on their peoples and cultures.

These countries are either entirely or partially within a climate that is most sustainable to life, making them by far the most inhabited areas of the planet.
