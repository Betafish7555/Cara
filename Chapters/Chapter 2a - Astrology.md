Cara is stationary at the center of the planetary system of the material plane, rotating on an axis diagonal to the position of the twin stars, Primus and Scholar. The day and night cycle is created by Caraâ€™s rotation around its axis which causes the twin stars to rise and set across different faces of the planet. The planets of Mon, Teler, Jenta, and Kane can be seen in the sky of Cara, making their orbit across the sky every day. They can be seen clearly like moons. The twin stars, however, are stationary and do not orbit around Cara with Primus staying on the Northern half of the planet, and Scholar on the South. Because of this, the poles on Cara are both massive deserts and the equator makes up a tremendous ring of ice that circles around the planet. On the equator, both stars can be seen on different sides of the sky at different times of day. There is always a star present in the sky, but so little sunlight, that the temperatures at the center of the equator reach uninhabitable levels for sustainable life. On the poles, however, the sun never sets. It merely spins in the sky in a perfect circle that becomes tighter and tighter until you reach what is referred to as The Focus Point of the planet, where the sun stays completely still in the center of the sky. The area where the sun never sets are referred to as the sun discs.

At the very center of the equator there is a stretch of a few miles where no sunlight reaches at all and is submerged in complete darkness. This area is often referred to as Shadow Line or its Elder Speak name, the Mykra. Because of the ring of ice, civilizations on the northern and southern hemispheres of the planet are separated from each other and fairly isolated from one another. In order to journey from one hemisphere to the other, you must either journey through underground tunnels on the continent of Kalastar or travel over sea through cracks in the ice that make passages across the Mykra known as shadow straits. Voyages and journeys from one hemisphere to another are not incredibly uncommon, but it is much more difficult than traveling within one hemisphere. If one wishes to journey across The Mykra, they must come prepared or they will die.

The inverse of the Mykra are the twin deserts on the planet's poles. The Primordial Desert on the northern pole and the Scholarian Desert on the southern pole. Because of the geography of the continents of Cara, the Primordial desert is a stretch of land in the center of the continent of Fera where it is so unbearably hot that traveling through it is almost unheard of. On the southern hemisphere however, the Scholarian Desert is mostly ocean which due to the extreme temperatures, is a deadly place that no living creature has known to survive. The intensity of the heat boils the ocean and causes a rapid succession of evaporation and perspiration at extreme temperatures. The entire sun disc is shrouded in a constant storm that is as hot as molten rock. The southern sun disc is often referred to as the Boiling Sea or the Demon Sea.
